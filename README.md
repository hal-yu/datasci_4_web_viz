## Challenges:
### SHINY R
- one of the challenges of using R was getting used to the platform on shiny. The dashboard had something everywhere, so it took a while to get used. The platform also had console, terminal, and other new tabs that we never saw before.
- When I tried to publish it, I couldn't get the link until I realized I had to go to shinyio instead of getting it from postitcloud. 
### Shiny Python
- I didn't really find anything challenging running it on python
### Flask
- There were some technical problems when running it through the terminal because the directory wasn't found when I used "python app.py"

## Observations
### Shiny R:
- Installing packages on R was a lot different from python. Once you save the file, it installs everything for you at once.
- Like python, we still had to download packages and the console and terminals still told you what the errors were.
- Formatting for the R script was similar to python, but using "<-" instead of "="
### Python Shiny
- Shiny python was almost exactly the same as running a regular python. The difference is instead of running "python [script name].py, we ran it through the port in shell. 
### General
- The formats were generally similar in that they all had the packages installed first. All the graphs and plots had specific axis labels.
